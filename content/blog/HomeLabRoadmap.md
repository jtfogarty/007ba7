#### Big Picture
The purpose of this HomeLab is for learning and there is so much to learn in today's software development landscape.  A firm knowledge of Networking, Kubernetes and all of the flavors of the Software development lifecycle are needed.
 - Continuous Integration (CI)
 - Continuous delivery (CD)
 - CI/CD
 - GitOps
 - Conversation-driven development (ChatOps)

And I'm sure before too long, I will be adding another line item to the above list.

To aid with learning the above, plugging into the [Jenkins-x](https://jenkins-x.io) project seems like an interesting idea.  [Jenkins-x 3.0](https://jenkins-x.io/docs/v3/guides/jx3/) is getting close to Beta and the project team mentioned that they are looking for on-prem hardware to help test.  This might be the perfect use case for this infrastructure.  

One of the big goals for the development environment is to be able to reinstall the entire bare metal cluster with minimal effort.  Changing the Kubernetes version and rebuilding to a baseline for the purpose of troubleshooting would be a fantastic feature.  

The big question is, how do I get there?  

Stay tuned...
