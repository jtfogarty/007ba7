Here is the current view.  

Starting with the [wall rack](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M1OCOC7/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1), top to bottom.

I've created an Amazon [list](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1WAP5034L6ZQL?ref_=wl_share) for most of these items

On the left of the table is a [SimplyNUC server shelf](https://simplynuc.com/3u-nuc-server-shelf/) with [3 - NUC10i7FNH](https://simplynuc.com/10i7fnh-full/), Power Supply and an unmanaged switch.
I also have [2 Gigabyte GB-BLCE-4105](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DMM7Z7N/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) 
The Power Supply feeds the 3 NUCs and the 2 Gigabytes.

In between the SimplyNUC shelf an the monitor is a [QNAP TS-473-4G-US 4-Bay NAS](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BMYKYKJ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

I also have 'gaming' machine, not in this picture.  The specs are below;
- AMD Ryzen 7 3800X 8-Core Processor with 16 cores
- 32GB of RAM
- 1TB nvme for the OS
- 2TB nvme for whatever
- NVIDIA RTX 2060 GPU

There is stack of Raspberry Pi's sitting on top of the NAS.  I was hoping to install [POWERPANELÂ® BUSINESS 4](https://www.cyberpowersystems.com/products/software/power-panel-business/) on one of the Pi's but this OS is not supported. 
I'll have to buy one more [Gigabyte GB-BLCE-4105](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DMM7Z7N/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

The keyboad is a [Das Keyboard 4](https://www.amazon.com/stores/Das+Keyboard/page/DF548711-D8BE-4659-83AE-A5FAFF411E10?ref_=ast_bln)
