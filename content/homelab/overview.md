Here is the current view.  

Starting with the [wall rack](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M1OCOC7/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1), top to bottom.

I've created an Amazon [list](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1WAP5034L6ZQL?ref_=wl_share) for most of these items

On the left of the table is a [SimplyNUC server shelf](https://simplynuc.com/3u-nuc-server-shelf/) with 3 NUCs, Power Supply and an unmanaged switch.
I also have [2 Gigabyte GB-BLCE-4105](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DMM7Z7N/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) 
The Power Supply feeds the 3 NUCs and the 2 Gigabytes.

The Black box with all the lights is a gaming machine I bought.  Probably should have made a different choice. The specs are below;
- AMD Ryzen 7 3800X 8-Core Processor with 16 cores
- 32GB of RAM
- 1TB nvme for the OS
- 2TB nvme for whatever
- NVIDIA RTX 2060 GPU
